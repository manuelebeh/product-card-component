## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### Continued development

I will continue to deepen my knowledge of responsive design, different techniques used and the use of css grid.

### Useful resources

- [Learn Flexbix](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - This will help you learn how to use flexbox. You'll learn about their usefulness in web development, and when and how to use them.
- [Learn CSS Grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) - Like flexbox, grid is a new layout that defines a grid which is then used to place child elements.
- [Learn Media Query](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This will help you understand what media queries are and how to use them.
